I had a very easy solution for my previous problem of not being able
 * to use the new method from Activity 7 on my drawPile. All I had to do
 * was make my drawPile which was originally an ArrayList of cards into
 * a new Deck object so that I could call my stateString method. After I
 * fixed that, my save method worked as intended.
 * The load method took me a while to code. Initially, I had problems
 * trying to print the right number of stacks and my drawPile was not
 * even printing. For example, Sometimes my stacks would print out 10
 * different stacks of cards.... when it was supposed to print out 7
 * stacks of cards. After saving multiple decks, I found the issue with
 * my while loop. It was that my scanner kept on scanning the next line
 * and adding the a deck into the stacks. Therefore, I had to create a
 * counter variable to count the number of lines I wanted my Scanner to
 * read. So if the counter was less than 7, than only 7 stacks of cards
 * would print, and if the counter is greater than 7, then the drawPile
 * would print.

I managed to finish this and think through this process by myself,
 * through debugging and numerous tests.",This lab was very hard and time consuming for me. Activity 7 itself took me 5 hours. Activity 1 through 7 (the whole Solitaire game) probably took me over 15 hours.,"Yes, I zipped my files and named my file properly.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/MrFerrante/63409231868158/3892114449943319183/P1_Nguyen_Quinlan_Solitaire.zip,3892114449943319183

/*
 * My name is Rohan Gumaste
 * I am in period 5
 * December 9th, 2018
 * 
 * I found the last part of the lab to not be too hard. I ran into a few
 * small bugs while loading the board, but these were not too hard to 
 * solve. The biggest problem that I ran into was that I needed a way
 * to show if a certain line in the save file was representing a drawPile. 
 * I decided to have a # if it was a drawPile. This worked, but if the drawPile
 * was empty, nothing would appear, so I had to troubleshoot this bug as well.
 * After spending some time working on this problem, I modified the needed methods,
 * and was able to solve the problem. Overall I am very proud of my work on this
 * lab, as this is probably the biggest project I have worked on. I would have
 * liked to spend some more time testing my code, but overall, I am very
 * happy with how this lab turned out.

I though that this was an awesome lab! I enjoyed building the game and trying to figure out how to make it work. I was super fun. I was harder in some section when you had to get your code to work for every test case, especially in the makeMove method. However, I was able to figure it out. Overall, this was a great lab!! Activity 7 took me about an hour and a half to two hours, I forgot to check the time when I started.
