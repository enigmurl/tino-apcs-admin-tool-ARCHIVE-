Reflection: I really enjoyed this lab. The logic itself really isn't that difficult, and I appreciated the opportunity to figure it out for myself. My largest sticking point was the recursive calls, where I accidentally made it so the base case was activated every time, and so, it didn't ever recurse outward. That small hiccup aside, I did fine.

I've added basically the rest of the console code as well.

 	A majority of the time I spent working on implementing the methods in my Model and debugging. My goal was to have the program at least setup the board. I reviewed the game rules and had to take special account of the fact that the first move has to work no matter of the position, so I had the program setup the board after taking in the initial starting row and column. After this step, I had the program print the board, but I had to debug this step since nothing was printing. I changed my Tile object such that it keeps track of its value as an integer, not as a character, which resolved the issue. The next step I did was implemented the surrounding cells method, which ran through the entire grid and changed the values to 1,2,3,4, depending on the number of neighboring mines. 
 	What I still need to do: 
 I still need to complete the recursion aspect of the game. I watched Mr. Mcleod's video explaining the concept using another game, but I still need to take time to implement it into the game. In addition, I have to change the print method in my Controller so that the Tiles are only printed if they are revealed. Finally, I need to add the game ending part, where if you try to reveal a mine, the game ends.",,I named my classes properly.,"https://www.jotform.com/uploads/MrFerrante/60667521982968/4617896768625824203/P4_Gupta_Amish_MSModelInterface.java

Thus, full data for the board cannot be generated until the user makes the first move, since we have to take into account which cell (the first move) cannot be a mine. However, in the example output, both the user's view and the actual data are generated before the first move. Since both things cannot happen simultaneously, I only printed the user's board (just with all the cells not revealed) just before the first move.

I also have another class called P1_Kim_Jinhyuk_Cell, which is for each of the individual cells in the board. This is to ask questions to each cell, such as whether is is revealed or what number it is.

 	 Time Taken: 4 Hours
  
 What I have accomplished so far: 
 	A majority of the time I spent working on implementing the methods in my Model and debugging. My goal was to have the program at least setup the board. I reviewed the game rules and had to take special account of the fact that the first move has to work no matter of the position, so I had the program setup the board after taking in the initial starting row and column. After this step, I had the program print the board, but I had to debug this step since nothing was printing. I changed my Tile object such that it keeps track of its value as an integer, not as a character, which resolved the issue. The next step I did was implemented the surrounding cells method, which ran through the entire grid and changed the values to 1,2,3,4, depending on the number of neighboring mines. 
  
 What I still need to do: 
I still need to complete the recursion aspect of the game. I watched Mr. Mcleod's video explaining the concept using another game, but I still need to take time to implement it into the game. In addition, I have to change the print method in my Controller so that the Tiles are only printed if they are revealed. Finally, I need to add the game ending part, where if you try to reveal a mine, the game ends. 
  	
  	
  4/5/2020
  Time Taken: 
  1.5 Hours
  	 What I have accomplished; 
  	 I was able to make the recursion part of the game work, even though I had to try multiple methods and debug it. This took the most time, but I drew a diagram, figured out every potential move, and wrote an if statement for each move and used recursion. I read the slide show, but I was still encountering an infinite loop, so I figured out that I was forgetting to change the cell I was moving on from as ""checked"" so I wouldn't re-check it. In addition, I fixed my printing method so that it prints cleanly with labels for the row and columns. Finally, I added the reveal button, making the game end if the user reveals a mine. 
  	 
 What I still need to do: 
I need to have a counter for how many mines are left/how many cells are flagged for the user, otherwise it is confusing for the player. In addition, I still need to clean up my code and comment it out for readability, which is something I am working on.
