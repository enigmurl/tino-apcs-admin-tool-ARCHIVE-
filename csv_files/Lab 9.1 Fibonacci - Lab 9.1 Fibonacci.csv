After investigating, the reason behind this is that int only can hold 4 bytes and has a maximum of 2147483647 and a minimum of -2147483648. Since fib(47) exceeds this value, Java undergoes integer overflow. The Fibonacci number for 47 is 2971215073. When fib(47) is calculated, the result first hits the maximum int value of 2147483648. Then, since it still hasn't reached the correct Fibonacci number, the result wraps around to -2147483648. The remaining value of the Fibonacci number (823731425) is added onto this, resulting in the output of -1323752223.","Yes, I named my class properly.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/MrFerrante/42690272201951/350400386874989899/P4_Shyu_Elaine_Fibonacci.java,350400386874989899

Its official range is -2147483648 to 2147483647. If an integer goes past this range, Java will not be able to store that number as an integer.

This is because computers use a 'wraparound' tactic to represent both positive and negative integers, where the greater half of the possible integer range is placed before the lower half and represents negative integers. Thus, when a number exceeds this lower, positive half (in this case, the 47th term of Fibonacci), it 'wraps around' to the upper, negative half. 
Notice that 2971215073 (47th term) - 2147483647 (integer max) = 823731426 (how much it exceeds the max). To convert this number to its negative counterpart, we would subtract it by 2147483649 (number of negative numbers plus 1 to account for 0) to account for the wraparound and receive the result that was outputted by the program, -1323752223.","Yes, I named my class properly.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/MrFerrante/42690272201951/4138205787316806737/P2_Rajesh_Ashwin_Fibonacci.java,4138205787316806737

The highest fibonacci number that a PC can calculate is in the 46th position of the Fibonacci sequence, which is 1,836,311,903. When computing the 47th number, the Fibonacci sequence value exceeds the maximum storage value for the data type int. The value displayed becomes negative. This is calculated by taking fibonacci(45) + fibonacci(46), which equals 2,971,215,073. Since the maximum capacity for a variable of data type int is 2,147,483,647, fibonacci(47) is over the limit by 823,731,425. The variable then restarts at the most negative value that an int can have, -2,147,483,648. 823,731,425 is added to -2,147,483,648 to get fibonacci(47) which the java program says is equivalent to -1,323,752,223.","Yes, I named my class properly.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/MrFerrante/42690272201951/4138333889729344992/P5_Huang_Steven_Fibonacci.java,4138333889729344992

We can't fit this in an int data type because the maximum value that can fit into an ""int"" is 2147483647. When an int reaches its maximum value, it will loop around to its minimum value and add whatever is left. So in this case, when the int reaches 2147483647 there is still (2971215073-2147483647) more to add. So java loops back to the minimum value which is -2147483648 and adds that remaining value.

It uses something called two's complement to represent the integers in binary. Supposedly this is why once they go over the maximum int value it returns a negative number instead.

When calculating the next fibonacci number, the program returns a negative number, -1323752223. The reason is because when an integer in java exceeds the maximum value of an integer 2147483647, which happens at n=47, the program adjusts by resetting the integer value to its minimum value, -2147483648, when it reaches the maximum threshold and adding the remaining value to that value. As a result, the program returns a -1323752223. 

The math can be seen here:
(-2147483648) + (2971215073 - 2147483647) = -1323752223 which is what java returns.","Yes, I named my class properly.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/MrFerrante/42690272201951/4139244521292223058/P5_Guduguntla_Praneeth_Fibonacci.java,4139244521292223058

I believe what happens is java tries to add f(45) + f(46) however this goes past the maximum value an integer can store (2,147,483,647). I suspect that the reason that this goes negative is that when you go past the carry bit, it may somehow trigger the sign bit to change. (the negative value is -1323752223) For example in an unsigned case, say there was a variable that could hold a single digit of decimal values (0-9) when I add 5+7, math wise it would be 12, but since the variable can only hold single digit numbers, it would represent it as 2. Likewise in a signed case, when the maximum value is reached, I think that the signed bit may be ""unintentionally"" triggered in the process of the carry, and thus makes it a negative number. Therefore Java got the answer by trying to add f(45) + f(46), couldn't store the whole number, and was only able to show the first 32 binary bits. However, the signed bit was most like switched to a negative state in the process, thus resulting in a negative number. Finally, I do have a hunch that -1323752223  - the smallest possible integer value + the largest possible integer value is the accurate representation of f(47), though I'm not completely sure, and I think has to do with the positioning of the signed bit.","Yes, I named my class properly.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/MrFerrante/42690272201951/4452857714813132016/P4_Bhat_Manu_Fibonacci.java,4452857714813132016

When the 47th number is attempted to be calculated, Java returns a negative number. The reason for this is that the 47th Fibonacci number is greater than the maximum value that the int can hold in Java. What Java seems to do is while computing the number is once it crosses the max value that an int type can hold (2147483647), it jumps back to the minimum value it can hold (-2147483648) (i.e. For 1 + 2147483647, Java returns -2147483648). Therefore, even though the 47th Fibonacci number is 2971215073, Java views it like (2147483647 + 1) + 823731425, which results in, due to the int limit mentioned above as (-2147483648) + 823731425 = -1323752223.","Yes, I named my class properly.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/MrFerrante/42690272201951/4779181327116242727/P1_Shah_Vishrut_Fibonacci.java,4779181327116242727

This is because the actual 48th term of the Fibonacci sequence exceeds the maximum integer that Java can store, represented by 31 1's in binary. When Java adds Fib(45) and Fib(46), integer overflow occurs and the value ""wraps"" around, resulting in a negative value for Fib(47). As a result of the wrap around, Java returns the 2's-complement of Fib(47), and since the 2's-complement representation of the binary representation of 2971215073 is -1323752223, Java obtains the value of -1323752223 for Fib(47).","Yes, I named my class properly.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/MrFerrante/42690272201951/4779438760421549265/P7_Liu_Andy_Fibonacci.java,4779438760421549265
